    "This code demonstrates how to create and use a basic agent powered by the Google ADK for Python. The agent is designed to answer questions by utilizing Google Search as a tool. First, necessary libraries from IPython, google.adk, and google.genai are imported. Constants for the application name, user ID, and session ID are defined. An Agent instance named \"basic_search_agent\" is created with a description and instructions indicating its purpose. It's configured to use the Google Search tool, which is a pre-built tool provided by the ADK. An InMemorySessionService (see Chapter 8) is initialized to manage sessions for the agent. A new session is created for the specified application, user, and session IDs. A Runner is instantiated, linking the created agent with the session service. This runner is responsible for executing the agent's interactions within a session. A helper function call_agent is defined to simplify the process of sending a query to the agent and processing the response. Inside call_agent, the user's query is formatted as a types.Content object with the role 'user'. The runner.run method is called with the user ID, session ID, and the new message content. The runner.run method returns a list of events representing the agent's actions and responses. The code iterates through these events to find the final response. If an event is identified as the final response, the text content of that response is extracted. The extracted agent response is then printed to the console. Finally, the call_agent function is called with the query \"what's the latest ai news?\" to demonstrate the agent in action."

The code initializes a VSearchAgent named \"q2_strategy_vsearch_agent\", providing a description, the model to use (\"gemini-2.0-flash-exp\"), and the ID of the Vertex AI Search datastore. The DATASTORE_ID is expected to be set as an environment variable. It then sets up a Runner for the agent, using an InMemorySessionService to manage conversation history. An asynchronous function call_vsearch_agent_async is defined to interact with the agent. This function takes a query, constructs a message content object, and calls the runner's run_async method to send the query to the agent. The function then streams the agent's response back to the console as it arrives. It also prints information about the final response, including any source attributions from the datastore. Error handling is included to catch exceptions during the agent's execution, providing informative messages about potential issues like an incorrect datastore ID or missing permissions. Another asynchronous function run_vsearch_example is provided to demonstrate how to call the agent with example queries. The main execution block checks if the DATASTORE_ID is set and then runs the example using asyncio.run. It includes a check to handle cases where the code is run in an environment that already has a running event loop, like a Jupyter notebook. \n"

Extensions offer enterprise-grade security, data privacy, and performance guarantees. They can be used for tasks like generating and running code, querying websites, and analyzing information from private datastores. Google provides prebuilt extensions for common use cases like Code Interpreter and Vertex AI Search, with the option to create custom ones. The primary benefit of extensions includes strong enterprise controls and seamless integration with other Google products. The key difference between extensions and function calling lies in their execution: Vertex AI automatically executes extensions, whereas function calls require manual execution by the user or client.\n"
